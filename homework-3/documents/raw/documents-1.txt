Python for Geospatial
If you are in the field of GIS, you're probably hearing everyone talking about Python, whether it's Arcpy in ArcGIS or special Python packages for doing things like geocoding.  In this course I am going to show you how to write Python code to perform spatial analysis.  The course isn't so much about learning Python, but rather how to integrate different spatial libraries within your Python code.  Using the course videos, you will work alongside of me to learn how I go about cobbling together Python code and various packages to solve spatial problems.  I'll provide you with all the data that I demonstrate in the course.
